        h5 Canvas Token
        p.
            The Canvas token allows the web extension to access your Canvas, so it can.
            show you useful information like your assignments. You must provide a Canvas.
            token for Canvas Integration.
        p.
            To gain access to your Canvas token, navigate to
            #[a(href="https://stevens.edu/canvas") Canvas] and click on your profile.
            Click 'Settings' and scroll down until you see 'Approved Integrations.'
            Click the 'New Access Token' button and enter 'stevens-web-extension' in
            the textbox labeled 'Purpose'. Leave 'Expires' blank and generate the token.
            Copy this token and paste into the box below and submit it. You may also
            want to copy it somewhere else for safekeeping, as Canvas hides it after it
            first generates it.
        p Note: DO NOT share your Canvas token with anyone!

        h5 Stevens Credentials
        p.
            In order to login to services such as myStevens, course registration,
            and other Stevens services automatically, you can store your Stevens
            credentials through the extension. Note: this data will only be stored
            on your browser in localStorage - please acknowledge that this is very
            dangerous and that you are accepting the risks associated with this
            process. The extension will still be able to automatically pull data
            from myStevens provided that you have logged in manually.
        p You can always keep this feature disabled using the options above.
