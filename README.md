## Steps to Making Changes
1. Get the latest code from the master branch: `git pull master`
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <feature_name> master` (`-b` creates the branch, checkout switches to it)
    - Make sure you are on the master branch, and do not forget to pull from the remote (web) repository
3. Make any change(s): `git add -A` (alternatively, `git add <filename>`) followed by `git commit -m <message>` (the message should be one sentence describing your changes)
    - Try to do this step every time you make a change that has an impact on the project
4. Make a pull request to be reviewed: `git push origin <feature_name>`
    - This will show up on the repository [here](https://github.com/adapap/stevens-web-extension/pulls)
5. Allow for someone to review your code, and then the change will be merged! Congratulations!
